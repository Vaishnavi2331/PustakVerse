                Reading is considered as the most intelligent habit. Reading is intelligent but it's also enriching,
                soothing, escapist, inspirational, transformative and a timeless journey.
                The habit of reading opens the door for completely new universes which existed merely as tiny
                filaments in our dreams. With the transformed approach, BookChor brings you these unimaginable
                filaments of wonders to your doorsteps.
